# Pomodoro Clock
This is my first Electron application. It is a simple pomodoro clock that allows for the addition of multiple clocks, and to start and stop voluntary short and long breaks.

This is an early version with just the basic logic built. I intend to revamp it and improve the UI in the near future.
