## Pomodoro Clock
This is my first Electron application. It is a simple pomodoro clock that allows for the addition of multiple clocks, and to start and stop voluntary short and long breaks.

This is an early version with just the basic logic built. For now it is built with vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS but I intend to revamp it and improve the UI with React the near future.
